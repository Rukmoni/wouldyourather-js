# Would You Rather React App

This project created for  Udacity Nanodegree Program(https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

## About App

web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules. users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.
